[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform that allows you to store, share, and archive files. It is commonly used for in research to make files accessible, including code, data, models, and figures. Sharing code and data through platforms like GitHub helps make research more transparent, reproducible, and credible [Braga et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14108). In this blog post, I will show you how to create your first GitHub repository ("repo" for short), how to set up a convenient folder structure, and how to push (i.e., upload) and pull (i.e., download) content to and from the repo. The [Center for Scholarly Communication](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/) (CSC) also runs a two-part workshop on how to use GitHub. The material is available on the CSC website: [Part 1](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/Intro-GitHub-Part-1.html) and [Part 2](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/workshops/Intro-GitHub-Part-2.html).

Before we start, you will need to download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) from [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/). While it installs, make an account on [https://github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one already.
